Since 2007, the Parisson company have been developping Telemeta, an open-source web audio framework for the management of and access to digital sound archives.

It focuses on the enhanced and collaborative user-experience in accessing audio items and their associated metadata and on the possibility for
the expert users to further enrich those metadata.

This platform has been deployed since 2011 in the context of ethnomusicological archives and hold the archives of the Center for Research in Ethnomusicology, which is the most important collection in Europe. The platform is fully operational and is now used on a daily basis by reasearchers, teachers and archivists in the fields of Ethnomusicology, anthropology, linguistics and acoustics.

One of the specificity of the Telemeta architecture is to rely on TimeSide, an open audio processing framework written in Python which provides decoding,
encoding and streaming methods for various formats together with a smart embeddable HTML audio player.
TimeSide also includes a set of audio analysis plugins and additionally wraps several audio features extraction libraries to provide automatic
annotation, segmentation and musicological analysis.
     
The Telemeta and TimeSide platform are available as open-source projects at the following adresses:
